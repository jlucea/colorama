# Colorama

**Colorama** is a personal playground for experimenting with SwiftUI colors and mesh gradients.

## Color Extensions

The `Extensions` folder contains useful extensions for working with colors, such as:

- `Color.random` → Generates a random color.
- `Color(hex: "#EBCECE")` → Creates a color from a hex value.

## Custom Mesh Gradients

The codebase includes several **static, custom mesh gradient examples**, designed with the help of **Stewart Lynch's** desktop app. You can download it [here](https://www.createchsol.com/StarterProjects/MeshGraidentCreator.dmg.zip).

## Dynamic Mesh Gradients

The `MeshGradients/Dynamic` folder contains **animated mesh gradients**, using the technique described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lsnGyF2WZg&list=WL&index=6&t=345s).

## Random Mesh Figures

A view that randomly generates a **mesh figure**, which is a mesh gradient using a set of **randomly placed points and colors**.
